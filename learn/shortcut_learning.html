        <h2 class="mt-5">What is shortcut learning</h2>
        <p>
            In a general sense, when training, deep neural networks are tweaking their internal parameters so as to maximize the number of 
            correct predictions. It often happens that it is able to maximize its performance by taking shortcuts instead of using the
            intended features. Such shortcuts consist of spurious artifacts in the training data that might not be present in different datasets.
            This leads to a lack of generalisation and unintuitive failures, since the model will not be able to do predictions on data without 
            the spurious artifacts this pattern can be observed in many real-world applications, as discussed in
            <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-020-00257-z">Shortcut learning in deep neural networks</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This phenomenon can happen in other areas of deep learning besides NLP, such as in computer vision.
        </p>

          <figcaption>Figure 1. An illustrative case of shortcut learning in computer vision. The model is trying to predict whether there is a husky or a wolf in the photo but it is actually predicting whether the background has snow, given that the original dataset was biased towards a correlation of the background having snow and the animal being a wolf.

        <h2 class="mt-5">Adversarial attacks</h2>
        <p>
            Shortcut learning in machine learning models makes them prone to perform poorly in the presence of adversarial attacks.
            An adversarial attack tries to make minimal superficial changes that are irrelevant for humans but that fool the model
            into changing its prediction to a wrong prediction. Given that shortcut learning means that the model takes into account
            spurious features, if an adversarial attack changes those features (which should have been irrelavant to solve the task) it will 
            change the prediction of the model.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although the concept of Adversarial Attacks can be explored in the context of Natural Language Processing and this is a very active 
            area of research, it is more commonly associated with computer vision. In computer vision, it is trivial to produce small changes
            that are undetectable by humans by tweaking the value of some pixels in the image while staying below a given threshold. By comparing
            the prediction of the model before and after the attack, it is possible to say if the attack was successful or not (by seeing if the 
            prediction changed).
        </p>
        <p>
            However, since NLP deals with discrete data (words), all possible changes are very visible to humans so an adversarial attack
            will necessarily change the original sentence, but it should try to keep the text's semantic meaning and grammaticality.
            Determining whether two sentences have the same semantic meaning is 
            <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2020.blackboxnlp-1.22.pdf">an open problem in NLP</a>, which means that automatically creating
            an adversarial attack that maintains the semantic meaning of the original sentence is non-trivial. As such, methods to produce
            adversarial attacks often involve the use of other NLP models, but those models won't guarantee that the semantic meaning is maintained.
            It is thus possible for an adversarial attack to change the target model's prediction but still be unsuccessful (because the meaning
            of the sentence actually changed after the attack and the new label is correct or because the sentence has lost its meaning), however there is no 
            way to automatically tell if that's the case.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, given the sentence "A bicyclist wearing white sunglasses and a white and black helmet.", it has an entailment relation 
            with the sentence "The human wears glasses.", but an automatic adversarial attack might change "glasses" to "bottles", which is a synonym
            in some cases, but not in this one, and the sentence doesn't have an entailment relation with "The human wears bottles.". It is
            expected that the model changes the prediction.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-4">Types of adversarial attacks</h3>
        <p>
            According to <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2020.findings-emnlp.341/"><em>Reevaluating Adversarial Examples in Natural Language</em></a>,
            there are 5 types of adversarial attacks:
        </p>
        <p>
            (Given the original sentence <em>"The teenager boy walks on the street"</em>)
        </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Attack by word insertion. <em>i.e. "The teenager boy <ins>happily</ins> walks on the street"</em></li>
                <li>Attack by word removal. <em>i.e. "The <del>teenager</del> boy walks on the street"</em></li>
                <li>Attack by synonym substitution. <em>i.e. "The <ins>adolescent</ins> boy walks on the street"</em></li>
                <li>Attack by paraphrase. <em>i.e. "A minor is on the street walking"</em></li>
                <li>Attack by character substitution. <em>i.e. "The teenager boy w<ins>o</ins>lks on the street"</em></li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            Attacks by character substitution aim at producing typos that a human wouldn't notice, however they will make the sentence 
            agrammatical and might even change the words to words of completely unrelated meaning. Attacks by paraphrase completely
            change the sentence but retain its original meaning. Attacks by word insertion and removal add or remove irrelevant information.
            Attacks by synonym substitution change the words with synonyms so that the meaning doesn't change although the token did.
        </p>


        <h3 class="mt-4">Attacks in the literature</h3>
        <p>
            Since this is a problem with active research in NLP, many attacks have been proposed in the literature. It is possible to experiment with
            them using the <a href="https://textattack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/apidoc/textattack.attack_recipes.html">TextAttack</a> python library.
            The following subsections will focus on the attacks available <a href="../adversarial_attacks.html">on this website</a>, which only do word insertion, removal and synonym substitution.
        </p>
        <h4 class="mt-4">TextFooler</h4>
        <p>
            Proposed in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11932"><em>Is BERT Really Robust? Natural Language Attack on Text Classification and Entailment</em></a>,
            it works by ranking the words according to their importance (that is, their capability of changing the model's prediction) and then substitutes the most
            important words by others such that the semantic similarity is above a given threshold.
        </p>

        <h4 class="mt-4">BERT-Attack</h4>

            Proposed in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09984"><em>BERT-ATTACK: Adversarial Attack Against BERT Using BERT</em></a>,
            it works finding the most vulnerable words (that is, the ones with more capability of changing the model's prediction), masks them,
            and uses BERT to predict new words for that context using masked language modeling.
        </p>
        <h4 class="mt-4">BAE</h4>
        <p>
            Proposed in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01970"><em>BAE: BERT-based Adversarial Examples for Text Classification</em></a>,
            it works by inserting or replacing tokens via BERT's masked language modeling.
        </p>

        <h4 class="mt-4">Kuleshov2017</h4>
        <p>
            Proposed in <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1QZ3zbAZ"><em>Generating Natural Language Adversarial Examples</em></a>,
            it works by greedily swapping the words that change the score the most, while forcing some constraints of semantic and syntatic
            similarity.
        </p>

        <h4 class="mt-4">PWWS</h4>
        <p>
            Proposed in <a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P19-1103/"><em>Generating Natural Language Adversarial Examples through Probability Weighted Word Saliency</em></a>,
            it works by prioritizing words for a synonym-swap transformation based on a combination of their saliency score and maximum word-swap effectiveness.
        </p>

        <h4 class="mt-4">InputReduction</h4>
        <p>
            Proposed in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07781"><em>Pathologies of Neural Models Make Interpretations Difficult</em></a>,
            it works iteratively removing the least important word in the sentence.
        </p>

        <h4 class="mt-4">CheckList</h4>
        <p>
            Proposed in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.04118"><em>Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of NLP models with CheckList</em></a>,
            it focuses on a number of attacks used in the Invariance Testing Method: Contraction, Extension, Changing Names, Number, Location.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, it changes the name of a person or location, changes a contraction to its extended form or vice-versa ("don't" and "do not"), and 
            it changes quantities.
